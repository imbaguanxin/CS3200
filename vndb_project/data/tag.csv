Typically anger and proximity (or actuality) of death only strengthen the characters, allowing them to draw out unfathomable power.\nBattles employing this plot device can typically always end either way, since there are objectively virtually no restrictions on the number of times you can power up with yet another attack more powerful than the last one you took.\n\nFor example:\nAs the hero gets beaten by the story's archvillain, he remembers a move his kung fu master taught him and uses it to take down his adversary.\nThe archvillain, baffled by this situation, gets angrier and turns into a demon which in turn beats down the hero.\nHero gets a sudden blessing from his dead-childhood-friend-turn-angel and blasts the demon with holy fire.\nIn response to that the demon-archvillain grabs a mecha, that was conveniently lying where he fell (or summons one out of thin air), and fuses with it to become an archvillain-demon-mecha and disintegrates the hero with laser beams.\nFollowing this the hero has a long scene about his past, friends, family, etc., which somehow renews his will and rouses him back from the dead as a super-human-angel-blessed-kung-fu guy and...\n\nIn short something like this good old [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16uevTBhgV4&feature=related]metallic knights[/url] movie."

3169,Unavoidable Netorare,"Netorare (寝取られ) is a sexual fetish designed to cause sexual jealousy by way of having the heroine indulge in sexual activity with someone other than the protagonist. This inevitably happens in this visual novel, regardless of your potential decisions.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:\n1. The heroine either must be romantically involved with the protagonist, a potential romance for him or of someone that the protagonist shares such a close relationship (sister, mother, osananajimi etc.) that jealousy is a factor.\n\n2. Related sexual events are explicitly shown to the player or later described in detail.\n\nThis does not include relationships of heroines that are outside the route you follow. Explanation: Route 1 is for Heroine A, the protagonist is romantically involved with her. During that route, if she sleeps with other characters than the protagonist, it would be NTR. But during Route 2, which is about Heroine B, where the protagonist has no romantic relationship with Heroine A, her having sex with others wouldn't count as NTR."
