Such suits may be either full-pressure (i.e. a space suit) or partial-pressure (as used by air crew). Partial-pressure suits work by providing mechanical counter-pressure to assist breathing at altitude.\n\nDiving suits that protect the wearer from excessively high pressure are called atmospheric diving suits. Pressure suits in general are examples of environmental suits."
549,Dog Tags,,"This character wears [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_tag]dog tags[/url].\n\nA dog tag is the informal name for the identification tags worn by military personnel, because of their resemblance to actual dog tags.

In addition there are often irregular serrations that lead the back edge of the blade to the spike. The blade is mounted atop a 1.5 m to 1.8 m long wooden or metal pole with a pointed metal counter weight used to balance the heavy blade and for striking on the opposite end. The blade is very deeply curved and therefore unlike most polearms, solely useful for sweeping cuts where it relies on range and power."
597,Scythe,,"This character has a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythe]scythe[/url].\n\nA scythe is an agricultural hand tool for mowing grass, or reaping crops.\n\nIt consists of a wooden shaft about 170 centimetres long called a snaith, snath, snathe or sned (modern versions are sometimes made from metal or plastic). The snaith may be straight, or with an ""S"" curve, but the more sophisticated versions are curved in three dimensions, allowing the mower to stand more upright. The snaith has either one or two short handles at right angles to it – usually one near the upper end and always another roughly in the middle. A long, curved blade about 60 to 90 centimetres long is mounted at the lower end, perpendicular to the snaith. Scythes always have the blade projecting from the left side of the snaith when in use, with the edge towards the mower. In principle a left-handed scythe could be made, but it could not be used together with right-handed scythes in a team of mowers, as the left-handed mower would be mowing in the opposite direction."
598,Polearm,Pole Weapon,"This character has a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_weapon]polearm[/url].\n\nA pole weapon is a close combat weapon in which the main fighting part of the weapon is placed on the end of a long shaft, typically of wood, thereby extending the user's effective range.\n\nSpears, glaives, poleaxes, halberds, and bardiches are all varieties of polearms. The idea of attaching a weapon onto a long shaft is an old one, as the first spears date back to the Stone Age. The purpose of using pole weapons is either to extend reach or to increase angular momentum—and thus striking power—when the weapon is swung.\n\nThis trait is intended to be used for made up or unidentified types of pole weapons that are not mentioned above, for those use (or make) the appropriate trait."
599,Blade,,"This character has a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade]blade[/url].\n\nThis trait is intended to be used for made up or unidentified types of blades that does not have well known real world counterparts, for the common types of blades, like [url=http://vndb.org/i73]swords[/url] and [url=http://vndb.org/i201]knives[/url] use (or make) the appropriate traits."
600,Hand Fan,Punkah\nFolding fan\nOugi\n扇,"This character is seen with a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_fan]fan[/url].\n\nA hand-held fan is an implement used to induce an airflow for the purpose of cooling or refreshing oneself. Any broad, flat surface waved back-and-forth will create a small airflow and therefore can be considered a rudimentary fan. But generally, purpose-made hand-held fans are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material (such as paper or feathers) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use.\n\nThe movement of a hand-held fan provides cooling by increasing the airflow over the skin which in turn increases the evaporation rate of sweat droplets on the skin. This evaporation has a cooling effect due to the latent heat of evaporation of water. Fans are convenient to carry around, especially folding fans."
601,Gardening,Horticulture,"This character engages in [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening]gardening[/url].\n\nGardening is the practice of growing plants. Ornamental plants are normally grown for their flowers, foliage, overall appearance, or for their dyes. Useful plants are grown for consumption (vegetables, fruits, herbs, and leaf vegetables) or for medicinal use. A gardener is someone who practices gardening.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees and herbaceous plants, to residential yards including lawns and foundation plantings, to large or small containers grown inside or outside.\n\nGardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a large number of different plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry."
602,Greatsword,Zweihänder\nGrete Swerd,"This character uses a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatsword]greatsword[/url].\n\nA greatsword is referenced today mostly as an extremely large or powerful weapon, like the [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zweih%C3%A4nder]zweihänder[/url], in comparison with less sizable weapons, such as the longsword or claymore.\n\nThese weapons fall between the line of the 16th century two-handed swords wielded by the landsknecht and the shorter arming sword of the knights and the spatha of the Romans and Vikings. The greatsword, and perhaps longswords in this manner, were not a form of ""specialized weapon"" as much as they were ""outsize(d) specimens"". Indeed, the weapons were referred to by a variety of names none of which, however, related to espée deuz mains, or twahandswerd, both meaning the huge Renaissance two-handed sword. Instead, the weapons were referred to as simply notably large weapons as in Grans espées d'Allemagne or ""big swords of Germany""."
603,Maul,War Hammer\nSledgehammer,"This character uses a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_hammer]maul[/url].\n\nThe maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy metal head, either of lead or iron.

604,Funny,Jokester\nComical\nHumorous,"This character is usually considered [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny]funny[/url].\n\nHumour or humor is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement.\n\nPeople of all ages and cultures respond to humour. The majority of people are able to experience humour, i.e., to be amused, to laugh or smile at something funny, and thus they are considered to have a sense of humour. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour induced by humour to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which an individual will find something humorous depends upon a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context."
605,Heterochromia,Heterochromia iridum\nHeterochromatic eyes\nDifferently colored eyes,"This character has [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia_iridum]heterochromia iridum[/url] (usually shortened to heterochromia). That is, their irises are different colours.\n\nThere are several types of heterochromia. In complete heterochromia, one iris is a different color from the other. In partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia, part of one iris is a different color from its remainder.\n\nIn visual novels, ""heterochromia"" usually refers to complete heterochromia. It may occur from natural causes, but is often indicative of a supernatural characteristic.\n\nWhen using this trait, also include the traits for the individual eye colours.\n\nFor characters with [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromia#Central_heterochromia]central heterochromia[/url], use [url=https://vndb.org/i934]Central Heterochromia[/url] instead of this trait."

Whereas justice implies actions undertaken and supported by a legitimate judicial system grounded upon a foundation of ethics and morals of the authorities, revenge implies actions undertaken by an individual or narrowly defined group outside the boundaries of judicial or ethical conduct whose goal is to force a wrongdoer to suffer the same or greater pain than that which was originally inflicted to a party."

The special abilities the jinyou have are a result of their youkai blood that they had inherited from their youkai ancestors (thus the nature of the abilities are also determined by their ancestors).\n\nThe kanji for jinyou is 人妖, first one meaning ""Man"" and the second one meaning ""Demon"" (this kanji is the same as the one in 妖怪 ""youkai"", which is referring to the supernatural beings in Japanese and Chinese mythology and doesn't always mean ""demon"" literally). Putting the two kanji together, it'll roughly mean, ""a human youkai""."
