After working on several famous TV productions and OVAs such as Ranma, he quit being animator and began working as game designer and illustrator, first with doujin games and later establishing an own company, [url=https://vndb.org/p2404]Silence[/url], which produced commercial games. The company focused on producing games which had actually animated scenes, by famous active animators, as such their games became instantly a hit in sales and allowed the studio to purchase an own building and establish several brands, such as [url=https://vndb.org/p461]Sogna[/url]. Most notably amongst its games was the Viper series, which had a large cult following. However, the one-man management of the firm and the latest part from the Viper series, VIPER-M3 3.2, which was for some four years in the making and had a troubling production schedule, contributed greatly to Sogna's financial dilemma and eventual downfall. After the announcement of the game in 1999, it was finally released in 2003 but the Sogna brand was forced to close soon after and Silence disappeared in 2004 and together with it did Nakamura. In 2007 he made a comeback as animator on the TV remake of Dancougar.\n\n[From [url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=10227]AniDB[/url]]",,

15270,m,"Nagai Gou is an iconic mangaka and perhaps one of the biggest influences in the world of manga and anime overall.\n\nIn 1968, Shueisha was about to release its first manga publication - Shounen Jump, and Nagai was invited as one of the first mangakas to publish their work there. He accepted and while it was his first long running series, it was a huge success, making Shounen Jump sell over one million copies. Name of the series was Harenchi Gakuen and with it, Nagai was the first to introduce eroticism in modern manga and became the creator of modern erotic manga. Harenchi Gakuen completely changed the common perception of manga as well as what would be appropriate to convey with it. Bluntly said, Nagai Gou is the main reason why majority of western folks think that manga and anime are nothing more than cartoon porn.\n\nIn 1970, Nagai Gou started a company, Dynamic Production, to fund his manga and anime ventures. Dynamic Production's first titles were Getter Robo and Abashiri Ikka.  [From [url=http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=creator&creatorid=868]AniDB[/url]]",,

15565,m,"Hiromichi Tanaka (田中 弘道 Tanaka Hiromichi, born January 7, 1962) is a Japanese video game developer, game producer, game director and game designer. He was Senior Vice President of Software Development at Square Enix (formerly Square) and the head of the company's Product Development Division-3. He is best known as the former lead developer of Final Fantasy XI, Square's first massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG). He oversaw ongoing development of that title and Final Fantasy XIV until late 2010. He also worked in a prominent role for earlier single-player games including Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Xenogears, Threads of Fate, Chrono Cross, and the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy III. (Tanaka had also worked on the original Famicon version of Final Fantasy III in 1990).\n\nIn 1983, Tanaka dropped out of Yokohama National University along with Hironobu Sakaguchi to join Square, a newly formed software branch of the Denyuusha Electric Company. Along with Sakaguchi and Kazuhiko Aoki, Tanaka was part of Square's original Planning and Development department.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV received a hostile reception from critics and players, and was considered a financial disaster for Square Enix. Three months after its release in 2010, Tanaka was removed from the Final Fantasy XIV team and replaced by Naoki Yoshida. At the Vana'diel Fan Festival 2012, a festival celebrating Final Fantasy XI's 10th anniversary, Tanaka announced his departure from Square Enix due to health reasons. In 2012, Tanaka joined GungHo Online Entertainment as a freelance adviser to the company.\n\n[From [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromichi_Tanaka]Wikipedia[/url]]",,

16584,f,"AKB48 (pronounced A.K.B. Forty-Eight) are a Japanese idol girl group named after the Akihabara (Akiba for short) area in Tokyo, where the group's theater is located. The group includes over 130 members as of December 2015, aged from their early teens to their mid-20s.[5][6] AKB48's producer, Yasushi Akimoto, wanted to form a girl group with its own theater (unlike pop groups performing occasional concerts and seen on television) and performing daily so fans could always see them live.[7] This ""idols you can meet"" concept includes teams[8] which can rotate performances and perform simultaneously at several events[9] and ""handshake"" events, where fans can meet group members. Akimoto has expanded the AKB48 concept to several sister groups in China, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines with upcoming groups announced for India and Vietnam.\n\nThe group is one of the highest-earning musical performers in Japan. In 2012, their sales reached $226 million. AKB48 has been characterized as a social phenomenon. As of June 2018, the group has sold over 56 million records, including over 6 million albums. AKB48 is the highest selling musical act in Japan in terms of singles sold. AKB48's thirty-five latest singles have topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, with thirty singles selling over a million copies each. Their highest selling single, ""Teacher Teacher"", sold over 2.9 million in 2018 according to Billboard / Soundscan. In 2010, ""Beginner"" and ""Heavy Rotation"" placed first and second, respectively, on the list of Japan's best-selling singles for the year. From 2011 to 2017, AKB48's singles have occupied the top four or five spots of the Oricon Yearly Singles Chart.",https://www.akb48.co.jp/,AKB48

18003,m,"Takanori Nishikawa (born September 19, 1970) is a Japanese musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and voice artist. He performs under the stage name T.M.Revolution (TMR), which stands for ""Takanori Makes Revolution"" (貴教が革命を起こす Takanori ga kakumei o okosu), stemming from the famous '80s pop electronic band TM Network. Despite most of his songs being written by Akio Inoue and composed/arranged by Daisuke Asakura (also TMR's former producer), T.M.Revolution is considered Nishikawa's solo project. Nishikawa is also known for contributions of ending and opening themes to many notable anime and game series.\n\nNishikawa debuted as TMR with the release of his first single ""Dokusai (Monopolize)"" (独裁 -monopolize-) in May 1996. Later that year, his third single ""Heart of Sword (Yoake Mae)"" (HEART OF SWORD ～夜明け前～) was used as the third ending song for the anime series Rurouni Kenshin, further expanding his fan base. He also contributed six songs to the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED franchise – three for Gundam SEED and three for Gundam SEED Destiny. Nishikawa has guest starred as a minor character in each of those anime series that featured his songs. In 2010, his single ""Save the One, Save the All"" was used as the ending theme song for the movie Bleach: Hell Verse. Nishikawa has also had a long-standing affair with Capcom's Sengoku Basara series of video games and media franchise, with several of his songs being used for it, including Crosswise and Flags.\n\nT.M.Revolution is the first artist to be signed to Tofu Records, a record label (affiliated with Sony Music Japan) promoting Japanese artists in North America. Tofu released three of his most recent studio albums: coordinate (2003), Seventh Heaven (2004), and vertical infinity (2005).",http://www.tm-revolution.com/,TMR15

After some personnel changes in the late 1980s, the band gained international fame as a duo consisting of Konishi and vocalist Maki Nomiya. The group, widely credited (along with Flipper's Guitar) for spearheading the Shibuya-kei movement of Tokyo in the 1990s, is known for electric and energetic compositions that often pay homage to late 1960s English-language pop music. The catchphrase ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" captured the group's ironic stance and eager attitude.\n\nPizzicato Five was a hugely prolific group during its existence, usually releasing at least an album each year in addition to various EPs and remix albums. Their music has appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and video games.",http://columbia.jp/~pizzicato/,
